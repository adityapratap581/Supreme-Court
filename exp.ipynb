I went home with\\nmy sister at around 11:30 pm and saw the door was purposely\\nlocked, which otherwise never used to be and we waited for almost\\nhalf an hour outside. Then when I asked the reason for locking, he\\nslapped me and pushed me. I started to say I would leave the house\\nbut when I refused she dragged me and in self-defense, I pushed her\\nback but she started shouting and calling the neighbors. Due to this\\npolice came and my sister Tanya Agarwal told me that 5-6 months\\nbefore marriage my husband tried to assault her physically and made\\nher eat an i-pill by force. When she said she wanted to tell me\\neverything, she was stopped and manipulated by him saying that it\\nwould destroy my life and she stopped and let the marriage happen\\nfor my good. Thinking he would change but she could not see me\\nsuffering so she told me the truth in the early hours of 9th March\\n2024.

My\\nhusband then accused me of theft. That night, Diwaker attempted\\nsuicide, and when I tried to intervene, my mother-in-law became\\nangry and threatened to throw me out of the house.\\nThe next day, I noticed that a wooden door in the\\nhouse, which had never been locked before, was suddenly locked\\nfrom the inside.
