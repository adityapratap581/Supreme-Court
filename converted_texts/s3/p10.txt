separate additional income and she could not afford
expenses for traveling and staying at Pune.

Inability to meet expenses: The respondent has not
given a single penny to the petitioner to maintain
herself and her son. As such, the petitioner has no
income by which she can manage herself. Petitioner
has filed application for interim maintenance and the
same is still pending before Court at Bengaluru.

Long Distance: The petitioner is staying in
Bangalore, Karnataka which is around 842 km from
Pune, Maharashtra. Around 14-15 hrs are required to
travel by bus or train. Although there are flights but it
is very expensive for the petitioner and she could not
afford it with her limited income. Travelling is also
expensive and requires somebody to accompany. The
petitioner-wife does not feel safe in taking this long
and tough journey alone. It needs at least 3 days for
attending one date of hearing of court proceedings.
Petitioner cannot leave her 10 year old son for 3 days

who is totally dependent on her.
