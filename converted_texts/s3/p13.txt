e This Hon’ble Court has repeatedly held that
in matters of this nature, especially when the
husband files a matrimonial case against the wife, it
is the convenience of the wife that is paramount.! The
petitioner has already suffered a lot of mental trauma
and agony at the hands of the Respondent, and it
would further increase her suffering if she has to
repeatedly visit Pune and incur enormous travel
expenses along with risk to her life and health just to
attend the judicial separation proceedings initiated by
the Respondent on completely false and frivolous
grounds.

In the above mentioned circumstances this

Hon’ble Court may consider the hardship = and
inconvenience cause to the Petitioner wife and transfer the
Petition for Divorce pending at 8 Joint C.J.S.D. and Addl.

C.J.M. Pune City, Pune, Maharashtra to the Family Court
