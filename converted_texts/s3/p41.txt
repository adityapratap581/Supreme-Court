father he had not called our son, but still the child wanted to speak
to his father and asked me to call him, I dialed the number and when
my son started to talk to him, he immediately said no one should call
me after 1O0PM and he did not even enquired to my child, no wished
him on his birthday, after this day child who is growing his feelings
too got shattered and now he is not having any feelings towards his

simple standard life, since I had a gap after marriage In my
