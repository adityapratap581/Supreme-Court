Pune. Petitioner filed police complaint at Adugodi
Police, Bengaluru and explained the details of the
incidence. Respondent is influential and resourceful
person and there is threat to the life of the petitioner.
Son of petitioner is studying in Bengaluru: Son of
petitioner, Kabir, is studying in Chinmay Vidyalaya
Bengaluru and therefore it is not possible for
petitioner to leave her son alone and to go to Pune for
attending court hearings.

Impermissibility of video conferencing: This
Honâ€™ble Court in Santhini v. Vyaya Venketesh, (2018)
1 SCC 1 held that video conferencing cannot be
deployed by Family Courts as a means to conduct
hearings in matrimonial matters unless (i) both
parties expressly consent to the same, and (ii) efforts
for reconciliation have been undertaken and have
failed. Neither condition is satisfied in the present
case. Further, the petitioner has no strong WiFi
internet connection to allow court hearings through

video conferencing.
