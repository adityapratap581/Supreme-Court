ili. It is submitted that, the distance between
Kolhapur and Bangalore is about 850 kilometres
and it takes around 14 tol5 hours for one way travel
by train/bus. It is very difficult to travel alone such
a long distance. The flight connectivity is also not
regular and frequent, rather it is highly expensive.
The Petitioner has to travel alone and now there is
no place for stay in Pune. In this situation it is very
difficult for petitioner to go to Pune and attend the
court hearing. It took at least 3 days to attend one
date. Petitioner has to stay in Pune and being a lady,
without getting any maintenance from respondent, it
will be an additional financial burden on the
petitioner. It will be rather in the interests of justice
to transfer the proceedings to Bangalore where the

Petitioner is staying with her parents.

iv. It is submitted that petitioner cannot afford
the travelling and other court expenses in Pune.

Petitioner is not getting any kind of maintenance
