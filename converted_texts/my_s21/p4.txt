rights over other encroached area. The order of
Hon'ble High Court merged with decision of trial
court and first appellate court and it becomes
conclusive and binding precedent.

Respondent filed execution petition and the same

is pending.

B. Second Round of Litigation:

1.

iv.

Respondent immediately filed R.C.S. no. 333 of
2000 on 02.05.2000 for declaration, possession
and perpetual injunction; same like earlier suit.
In this suit it was alleged that the petitioner had
encroached 25 sq. mtr. in addition to earlier 13
sq. mtr.

However, it is the case of the petitioner that they
are in possession of 2.2 Guntha of S. No.17/5 for
more than 50 years.

The said suit was decreed and petitioner filed
appeal (no. 53/2015). The appeal was dismissed
and petitioner filed Second Appeal no. 626 of

2022 and the same was also dismissed.
