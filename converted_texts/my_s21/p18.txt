the time of filing of written statement it was known -

* © the defendants petitioner-landlord about the
Porition of the tenancy and whether the plaintiff. , !
tenant was a licensee in respect of plot No.24, Even ~~
from the deposition of the plaintiff ie. PW.1 it was
extract from him in his cross-examination held on
27-5-93 that the plan is a correct one, as annexed’ to
‘the. plaint and the challenge was thrown to that
effect in cross-examination. So that position was
known even in the month of vay, 1993, but the
defendant sat idle over this matter for the purpose
of bidding time. He allowed the matters to go on
and even after the stage of evidence when! the
matter awaiting arguments he came forward with
an application for local investigation. In my view, .
this is nothing but to fill up the iacune in the.,
evidence of the defendants landlords.. In other“?
words, for the purpose of fishing an evidence, they
Gefendants could mot supply evidence and-
according to the decision of that Court in the case
of Thane Institution of Engineers (India) (Supra)
such practice should not be allowed if this is for the
purpose of fishing out evidence. I am not unmindf
that the case relied is on the point of Order 39, Rule
7 Of the Code of Civil Procedure but that principle
‘can be applied even in case of local investigation
under Order 26, Rule 9 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and for that purpose the principle should
be extended. As it is a ploy to protracr the
limitation. " |
