It is submitted that the respondent filed
application for appointment of commissioner to prove map
at Exh.61 and also to ascertain exact location and
boundaries of encroached area. The said application was
rejected by trial court and the order was confirmed till this
Hon'ble Court.

It becomes very clear that respondents could not
prove the exact location of the encroached area and
substantial question of law for general importance that;
whether the Court can pass decree on the basis of vague
description of property? Who has responsibility to prove
encroachment? Is it not the duty of plaintiff to prove his
case? Whether plaintiff has proved encroachment in
absence of clear proof of map?

Whether the subsequent suit is barred by
principle of Res- judicata and estoppel as stated in 5.11 of
C.P.C.?

Whether respondent has relinquished his rights
other than 13 sq. mtr. in the background of order dated

07.04.1999 passed by Honâ€™ble High Court in Second Appeal
